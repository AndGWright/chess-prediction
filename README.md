# chess-prediction

The goal of this project is to understand how well we can predict the winner of a chess match based on features such as rating (ELO), the number of turns of the match, and the opening that was played (chess.ipynb). From there, I used the Stockfish engine to evaluate the position at the halfway point through each match to see how that adds to the predictive power of the model (stockfish.ipynb). My next steps for this project are to additionally evaluate various other points in the match, and then to use these predictions to understand how important the evaluation on its own is at a given point versus other available factors. A couple motivating questions for this project overall are how much of an early advantage does a player need in order to have a good chance at defeating a higher rated player, to what extent can we do better than an engine evaluation to measure a player's chances of winning partway through a match, and at what point is it worth it for a player to forfeit a match due to a very low chance of winning.

The dataset used here is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess
It consists of a sample of 20,000 matches played on Lichess across the top teams at the time of the datapull in 2017. I plan on supplementing this data with additional matches played since by using the full Lichess database found here: https://database.lichess.org/
